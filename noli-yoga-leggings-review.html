Think again. The best one-piece swimsuits continue to be a staple that's well worth having in your arsenal, especially as designs are becoming bolder and more exciting. “Novelty embellishments are everything right now — from funky prints to beaded straps, there’s a lot of appetite for swimwear that helps you stand out,” says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>Caroline Maguire</a>, fashion director at Shopbop.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">And, it's easy to see why fashion-forward celebs have been ditching their itty-bitty bikinis in favor of the more modest silhouette. Not only are one-piece swimsuits <strong>extremely flattering</strong> on practically every body type, but you can also layer the versatile pieces under skirts and pants to turn them into a cute top.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>editors individually tested</a> 36 pieces of swimwear on various bodies and during different occasions, including at the pool and engaging in activities like jet skiing and beach volleyball, to see which held up for <strong>comfort</strong>, <strong>support</strong>, <strong>style</strong>, and <strong>coverage</strong>. We also tapped into editor and expert recommendations and product reviews, to find the best pieces for vacations ahead.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-andie-the-amalfi></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Andie The Amalfi</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Andie The Amalfi" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/nCBjkLU297ETRmPg-Ta9vwnMcMk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/andie-the-amalfi-6ab60441f0af47efaa963089ab07e23e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Andie&nbsp;</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Despite the straps being rather thin, they held up our E cups like it was no big feat.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The leg cutout is rather high and shows off a good chunk of your hips.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Once we finally got our hands on this <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>ultra-flattering one-piece</a>, we never wanted to take it off — seriously, its <strong>shapewear-like fit </strong>made us look that good. We were able to choose between a <strong>smooth, ribbed, and patterned fabric</strong>, among <strong>eleven colors</strong> (and <strong>seven sizes</strong>!), so it was easy to find something that matched our individual tastes. Once on, we were delighted to find that the deceivingly thin, <strong>adjustable straps</strong> held up our E cups like it was nothing. Even while on waterslides (yes, we wore it to an amusement park), this suit <strong>stayed in place </strong>and kept <strong>everything concealed</strong>. It was one of those swimsuits we felt comfortable enough to run around in, eat in, and do more than just lie around and look cute (although we did look cute). Just be aware that the leg cutout does come up a little high.

The material itself stretches a lot giving us <strong>full mobility</strong> while wearing it. If you have a long torso, you’ll be happy to know that this fits our 5-foot, 9-inch tall body like a glove.

The fabric also made it more sturdy, never changing in elasticity when wet. It withstood our intense wringing and did not show signs of stretching or damage.

Let us explain; <strong>built-in shapewear</strong> snatches waists to accentuate curves and turn straight silhouettes into voluptuous hourglass figures. Not to mention, each of the 11 <strong>rich-looking-hued colorways</strong> is stunning (though we’re partial to the captivating sapphire hue that camouflages well into fitting for any oceanic adventure).

While this colorway gorgeously contrasts against the <strong>gold hoop accent</strong> and shows off the <strong>ribbed detailing</strong> more than the other hues, the Twilight shade features a stunning metallic finish that makes it a truly eye-catching piece.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Additionally, the fit was remarkable. “I’m tall, but my torso is an awkward length where cutout tops always hit me in weird, ill-fitting spots, but I was thrilled that this one piece sat snugly against my body so no matter how much I twisted and turned it showcased the cheeky, exposed bit of skin as intended by the triangle-shaped design,” says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Irene Richardson</a>, an InStyle commerce writer and co-author of this article. Although we’re concerned about how much support the lack of an underwire would provide larger chests, we do appreciate that the sturdy double-strapped design holds up the top half of the bathing suit.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XS–XL | <strong>Colors: </strong>3 | <strong>Padding: </strong>No |<strong> Material: </strong>Nylon, spandex</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-high-neck-spanx-pique-shaping-high-neck-one-piece></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best High-Neck</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Spanx Pique Shaping High Neck One-Piece</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Spanx Pique Shaping High Neck One-Piece" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/35FFuTP_qc_lVMCdq9ojnbTj4Ac=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/spanx-pique-shaping-high-neck-one-piece-fedec35f0c154583beb8e17c976816eb.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Spanx</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>With a figure-smoothing fabric and classic design<strong>, </strong>we’re living in the full coverage option in and out of the water.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It only comes in black.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Spanx may be the gold standard for crafting the most figure-flattering, comfiest, and modest clothing that doesn’t look dowdy — its <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>butt-flattering pants</a> are life-changing – and its high-neck one-piece defies the notion that full coverage can’t also be chic. A bit of <strong>cheeky coverage</strong> on the backside and <strong>exposed back</strong> give it a bit more of an alluring edge, and one you’ll feel fully confident wearing thanks to Spanx’s signature-shaping technology featured in the <strong>compressed midsection</strong>. It’s easy to jump in and out of, too, thanks to the <strong>easy-to-reach back clasp</strong>. While the deep black shade only does more favors for our figure, we’d be thrilled if we could parade around a couple of punchier hues, and hopefully, Spanx will consider expanding the color options soon.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XS–3X |<strong> Colors: </strong>1 | <strong>Padding: </strong>Removable | <strong>Material: </strong>Nylon, elastane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-scoop-neck-hanky-panky-ruched-bow-one-piece-swimsuit></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Scoop-Neck</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Hanky Panky Ruched Bow One Piece Swimsuit</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Hanky Panky Ruched Bow One Piece Swimsuit" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/S3ICKQh7OSiCZ97kSnB2EKbK6vg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/hanky-panky-ruched-bow-one-piece-swimsuit-20071f73ba664a00aea22c181e451c08.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Hanky Panky</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The tie bow details are not only an adorable design accent, but this adjustable feature also allows wearers to manipulate the swimsuit for the best fit.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>You will likely have to size down.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Complete with a <strong>supportive soft scoop neckline</strong> and endearing <strong>bow straps</strong>, we’re beholden to the feminine, and functional, charm that accompanies this sweet little number. “I’m obsessed with how the one-piece has a <strong>seamless</strong> design and is <strong>double-lined</strong> so that it hugs my body and flatters my silhouette for an ultra-sleek look, but not at the sacrifice of showing, well, everything underneath,” says Richardson. Plus, she says its <strong>recycled nylon fabric </strong>is one of the <strong>softest materials</strong> she’s ever experienced from swimwear. “It’s like a mixture between silk and plush cotton,” adds Richardson, who says that trying the swimsuit on just for fun resulted in her hanging around her apartment in it for hours thanks to its loungewear-adjacent feel.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Although the swimsuit runs a little large (we found ourselves dealing with a lot of extra fabric on the top half), its adjustable features still keep the top half securely in place.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> XS–XL | <strong>Colors:</strong> 3 | <strong>Padding:</strong> Removable | <strong>Material:</strong> Nylon, elastane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-shapewear-miraclesuit-escape-one-piece-allover-slimming-underwire-swimsuit></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Shapewear</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Miraclesuit One-Piece Slimming Underwire Swimsuit</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Miraclesuit Escape One-Piece Allover Slimming Underwire Swimsuit" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/5a0Em3UvA25BzeDH-nmoWx0P_8U=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Escape-One-Piece-Allover-Slimming-Underwire-Swimsuit-9a3f8ca5600b4f97bfee159ef1622c66.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> This vintage suit lifts and tones.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The underwire in the cups can pop out.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">How sleek is this suit from Miraclesuit?

The <strong>ruffled off-the-shoulder silhouette</strong> will look great on all shapes and sizes, and the bathing suit also comes with <strong>removable straps</strong> to make it feel more secure.

Not to mention, while the <strong>low back</strong> reaches just far down enough to add some interest, we never found ourselves constantly tugging it up for fear of revealing too much.

"It doesn't feel suffocating or squeeze me in the wrong places, and the cheeky cut is just cheeky enough that it's super cute and won't get scrunched up in your derrière." While she appreciates the <strong>adjustable straps</strong> in the <strong>spaghetti strap design</strong>, you can also buy the one-shoulder version.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-96 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> S–XXL | <strong>Colors:</strong> 40 | <strong>Padding:</strong> Removable | <strong>Material:</strong> Nylon, spandex</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-scalloped-cupshe-knotted-scalloped-one-piece-swimsuit></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Scalloped</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Cupshe Knotted Scalloped One Piece Swimsuit</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/e_JdWpIHCuqpE8OaVLxGA4NOenQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/cupshe-knotted-scalloped-one-piece-swimsuit-648ab233605d4781ac310043d55d4113.jpg"><p><strong>What We Like: </strong>The scallops and cutouts make this suit extra flirty.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Like: </strong>You may get some underboob action.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-99 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Scallops add a little pizazz to the most basic swimsuit, and this design by Cupshe is the perfect balance between simple and flirty. The <strong>knotted top </strong>is extra adorable but also provides the functionality of <strong>adjustable straps</strong>, <strong>removable pads</strong>, and <strong>back hook closure</strong>. Those with bigger breasts may have some underboob, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing.

The ruffles play up your chest while hiding any trouble spots on your arms, and the design features one of the hottest swim trends of the season, cutouts. With all the <strong>vivid colors</strong> and <strong>high-quality materials</strong>, like durable nylon and spandex fabrics, you can easily wear this suit outside of the pool as a top and pair it with<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1> snazzy sunglasses</a> to complete the look.

It’s made with a lightweight material with a lot of stretch and <strong>long, adjustable straps</strong> you can play with depending on your torso length and how far down you want the deep V-neck to hit. Beyond that, the whimsical mélange of <strong>florals and abstract shapes</strong> printed on the verdant fabric and romantic ruffles make this piece far too stunning to hide under a beach umbrella. As Maguire notes, “I love this bright, mixed print silhouette — and it comes with a matching cover-up that can take you from the pool to happy hour.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-108 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>P–XL | <strong>Colors:</strong> Veridian | <strong>Padding: </strong>Yes<strong> </strong>| <strong>Material:</strong> Polyamide, elastane<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-cutout-becca-color-code-santorini-one-piece-swimsuit></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Cutout</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Becca Color Code Santorini One-Piece Swimsuit</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/KIOT0-wX7X5SJjZ276xJuV876vw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/becca-color-code-santorini-one-piece-swimsuit-4aaac62c194b44bdb77c35155ee6e4d0.jpg"><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It combines the look of a bikini with the support of a one-piece.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> If you’re looking for modest coverage the high-cut design could be too cheeky.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-111 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Slipping into a bikini is all fun and games until you’re left yanking at slippery strings and tugging on a saggy bottom. The hack? This cut-out one-piece from Becca one-piece that marries all the flirtatious charm of your stringiest two-piece and layers on the coverage and support only a one-piece design can provide. Though its <strong>high-cut leg</strong> could mean you’re showing a bit more skin in the behind area, we’re fans of how this design choice<strong> lengthens the look of our legs</strong>, extending our silhouettes into a true modeled-like form<strong>.</strong> The <strong>three front cutouts</strong> stop just short of the belly button, but this party continues in the back with a <strong>strappy tie-back bow</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-112 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> S–L | <strong>Colors:</strong> 2 | <strong>Padding:</strong> Removable | <strong>Material:</strong> Nylon, spandex</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-racerback-body-glove-smoothies-mylene-one-piece-swimsuit></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Racerback</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Body Glove Smoothies Mylene One-piece Swimsuit</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Body Glove Smoothies Mylene One-piece Swimsuit" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/taOIql5I1bsuOqjEjz-wjCSdtlU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/body-glove-smoothies-mylene-one-piece-swimsuit-7def41e5c6e740ebb4e3fd8f5a84181a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> We were able to do butterflies, sprints, and flip turns, and the piece kept up with our movements immaculately.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It clings onto the body when wet, revealing everything underneath, including our belly buttons.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-115 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We really put this number's support to the test, by wearing it to a full swim workout routine, and color us impressed with how it held up. Despite the keyhole back, both sides of the body stayed <strong>comfortably covered</strong>, and <strong>never gaped</strong> or required us to adjust it awkwardly, even while doing butterflies, flip turns, and sprints. While it’s not exactly an Olympian’s swimsuit (you know, the ones that go all the way up to your neck and are skin-tight), this did allow us to engage in our full range of motion without ever worrying about exposing ourselves.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-116 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">On top of that, the suit feels<strong> very lightweight </strong>while still providing coverage, so it was flexible to move around in both wet and dry conditions. When wet, it clings to the skin quite noticeably. We didn’t love how our entire front’s outline was visible (belly button and all) but with the built-in bra, at least our nipples were spared from poking through. It was also<strong> quick to dry</strong> while on, so it never occupied our minds for too long, and it remained opaque through it all.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-117 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> XS–XL | <strong>Colors:</strong> 14 | <strong>Padding:</strong> Yes | <strong>Material:</strong> Nylon, spandex</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-lap-swimming-tyr-durafast-elite-solid-maxfit-one-piece></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Lap Swimming</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>TYR Solid Maxfit One-Piece</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="TYR Durafast Elite Solid Maxfit One-Piece" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/AzRkuxogz3IyYV81H2v-noDb5a8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/best-one-piece-swimsuits-3b6cf81a12034be58a436282ce65f654.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The<strong> </strong>durable fabric stands up to chlorine and offers sun protection for the regular swimmer.<br><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>The suit runs a bit small.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-120 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you're looking to go all the way with a high-performance suit for laps in the pool, then check out this option from TYR. We especially love that the <strong>fully lined, odor-resistant </strong>one-piece accounts for outdoor swimming, as it boasts <strong>UPF 50+ protection</strong> to keep your skin protected from the sun's harmful rays.

We loved everything about this one piece, from the <strong>adjustable straps</strong>, <strong>ruched front,</strong> <strong>sweetheart neckline</strong>, and most of all, support. Yes, our big chests were not only properly fitted (you chose your size based on your cup size) but also held up comfortably thanks to the cupping and underwire. The additional back clasp, not unlike a bra, provides some <strong>additional support</strong> and lift as well. This option was great for when we wanted support that still felt sexy, as the lower neckline allowed us to get a nice chest tan (post<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1> sunscreen</a> application, of course).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-125 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The swimsuit never retained a lot of water after we wore it in the pool. In fact, it dried up pretty quickly without ever weighing us down or leaving us feeling sticky. The material was constructed with precision and care, so we feel comfortable spending a little more on a piece that will likely last for many seasons to come. The only thing is that it’s a little long on petite women. If you have a shorter torso, you’ll notice some extra fabric around the tummy bunching up, as it did on our five-foot-two body.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-126 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 30D–40K | <strong>Colors:</strong> 2 | <strong>Padding:</strong> Yes | <strong>Material:</strong> Polyamide, elastane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-strapless-robin-piccone-aubrey-bandeau-one-piece></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Strapless</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Robin Piccone Aubrey Bandeau One Piece</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Robin Piccone Aubrey Bandeau One Piece" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Bvbx1EfzeDmKXriA-X58_ie8aSo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/robin-piccone-aubrey-bandeau-one-piece-6b730e102c1e4772b1300de574eb44d8.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Robin Piccone</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The material is next-level soft, sturdy, and lightweight, making us look and feel amazing in it.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> There aren’t many color options.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-129 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We have one word to describe this swimsuit: wow. We give this piece ten’s across the board, from the coverage to the material to how flattering it is. If you want to look amazing, but still feel comfortable (especially around family members), this swimsuit offers <strong>full coverage around the chest and the bum</strong>. The side ties and ruching keep things lighthearted and flirty, and there’s even an included neck strap in case you find yourself wanting to switch up the style.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-130 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">But we really can’t rave enough over the material.

Two front straps attach in an <strong>artistic crossover design</strong>, hooking with a<strong> golden clasp</strong> at the top of our left shoulder to complete the intriguing <strong>asymmetrical silhouette</strong>. Though it’s a sophisticated design, we wouldn’t wear this anywhere you don’t show a lot of skin because the <strong>thong-style back coverage</strong> is quite cheeky.

Plus, the <strong>adjustable front-tie straps </strong>offer the opportunity to switch up the style: We can fasten them up around our neck, a plus for bigger busted girls who need more support, or behind our back. If you’ve got a wild streak to you like we do, you’ll swoon over the <strong>funky paisley print </strong>and <strong>radiant flamingo pink.</strong> However, there are more neutral color options, too, like a solid black shade and a black and white polka dot design.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-140 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> XS–XXL | <strong>Colors:</strong> 4 | <strong>Padding:</strong> Removable | <strong>Material:</strong> Nylon, elastane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-look-for-in-a-one-piece-swimsuit></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Look for in a One-Piece Swimsuit</span></h2><ul id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><li><strong>Material:</strong> Sometimes, your swim plans only consist of lying by the pool or on the beach. In those cases, you can’t go wrong with most swim fabrics. However, if you plan to swim regularly in chlorine or salt water, look for durable fabrics, like nylon and spandex, that have been proofed for chlorine and offer sun protection. These features, along with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>proper care</a>, can help your swimsuit last longer. Today, you can also find swimwear with compression material that provides extra support to areas like your tummy and butt.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Padding: </strong>To pad or not to pad? Many swimsuits offer removable cups while others come with no padding whatsoever. Depending on your cup size, you may appreciate the extra shape and support of a built-in bra as well as the nipple coverage. Others may enjoy the more natural look and feel of no padding. “Swim padding is always a personal choice. Some people, myself included, don’t care as much and love a little side or underboob,” says Rosenbaum. “Others want their ladies locked in place. If you’re the latter, I would recommend a suit that at least has optional removable cups.”</li><li><strong>Lining: </strong>Have you ever come out of the water only to find that your suit has become practically see-through, especially in all the wrong places? That’s the pitfall of unlined suits, even if the fabric comes in a dark color. To avoid the mishap, double-check if the suit is double-lined, especially when browsing cheaper styles. Also note that some suits have a light inner lining, even when the outside shade is darker. The lining can pop out as you swim and move around, so if you think this mismatch will bother you, look for suits that are the same color on the inside and outside.</li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do I shop for a one-piece when I’m different sizes on top and bottom?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One of the downsides of a one-piece is that you can’t choose a different size top and bottom, as you can with a two-piece. Don’t give up though. Rosenbaum offers a few tricks and features for finding the ideal-sized one-piece.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“I always recommend starting from the bottom and working your way up. You can often adjust the top of a one-piece, but the bottoms are usually a bit more rigid, So if you’re a medium on the bottom and a large on top, go for the medium suit, and shop a style that features a top that can be loosened,” says Rosenbaum. “Lean into your coverage preference. If you like less coverage, you won’t mind the added cheekiness and exposure of a smaller suit.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Additionally, plus-size fashion influencer <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Jamie Hamilton</a> says, “If you are different sizes on top and bottom, I always suggest fitting for the largest body part and having the rest tailored for a perfect fit.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do I style a one-piece so it feels modern and trendy?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Swimsuits aren’t just for the water. Whether you are going from brunch to the beach or dressing up for a pool party, a one-piece can easily become the foundation of a summer outfit. “Versatility is key,” says Maguire. “If a swimsuit has a matching coverup, we definitely see shoppers gravitate towards those styles too — everyone loves a head-to-toe look.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">And with all the stylish offerings today, you can wear your favorite one-piece as a body suit for a night out. All you need is the right accessories to complete the look. “I love piling on accessories like beaded necklaces, belly chains, and beach totes to pull together a whole look. A sheer coverup or pareo also elevates any swim costume,” says Rosenbaum. “Denim, whether it be high-waisted jeans or a ’90s style jacket, takes your one-piece to a whole other level for off-the-beach wear. And, if you’re feeling extra bold, you can style your favorite one-piece over a longer-sleeve top for a chic layered look.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Additionally, Hamilton says that styling your suit is all about cut and color. “Buy trending colorways and patterns, consider a high-leg cut, cheeky bottoms, or even a swimsuit with sleeves,” she says, adding, “You can even get a peekaboo cut-out for a fun flair.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Is it better to size up or down in a one-piece swimsuit?<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Whether to size up or down often depends on a retailer’s specific sizing, but generally, Hamilton says that she always goes up one additional size in one-piece swimsuits. However, more importantly, she looks out for supportive design details to ensure the best fit. “<strong>Adjustable straps</strong> are a must for an optimal fit — it’s so annoying when straps fall,” Hamilton says.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">InStyle beauty and fashion writer <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Irene Richardson</a> updated this piece with additional insights from Caroline Maguire, fashion director at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Shopbop</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Novel Swim</a> designer Laura Paulino Rosenbaum, and Jamie Hamilton, plus-size influencer and digital creator, and editor-tested product picks.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Emily Cieslak</a> is a former commerce editor at InStyle and has worked on many sides of the fashion industry, including as a stylist and fashion buyer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57xZqqoaGfo3yvu8uiZLKnl5Z6rbHGoKCnn6Niv6bCyJ6u</p></content><div></div><section class=sk3-margin-v-full><section class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h"><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><sk3-social><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=%2fnoli-yoga-leggings-review.html&title=The%2032%20Best%20One-Piece%20Swimsuits%20of%202024%2c%20Tested%20and%20Reviewed" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"LinkedIn","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#linkedin"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fnoli-yoga-leggings-review.html&description=The%2032%20Best%20One-Piece%20Swimsuits%20of%202024%2c%20Tested%20and%20Reviewed" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Pinterest","width=800,height=720,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#pinterest"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fnoli-yoga-leggings-review.html&title=The%2032%20Best%20One-Piece%20Swimsuits%20of%202024%2c%20Tested%20and%20Reviewed" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Reddit","width=832,height=624,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#reddit"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//t.me/share/url?url=%2fnoli-yoga-leggings-review.html&title=The%2032%20Best%20One-Piece%20Swimsuits%20of%202024%2c%20Tested%20and%20Reviewed" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Telegram","width=800,height=600,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#telegram"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//twitter.com/intent/tweet/?url=%2fnoli-yoga-leggings-review.html&text=The%2032%20Best%20One-Piece%20Swimsuits%20of%202024%2c%20Tested%20and%20Reviewed" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Twitter","width=800,height=450,resizable=yes,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#twitter"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//vk.com/share.php?url=%2fnoli-yoga-leggings-review.html" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"VK","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#vk"/></svg></a></sk3-social></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><div class=sk3-margin-h><h3>Patria Henriques</h3></div><div class="sk3-margin-h sk3-margin-down">Update: 2024-08-13</div></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./meghan-duchess-of-sussex-leather-skirt.html><h3>&lt;&lt;
