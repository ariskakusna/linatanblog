You're lookin' out for me; you've got my back
It's so good to have you aroundYou know the secrets I could never tell
And when I'm quiet you break through my shell
Don't feel the need to do a rebel yell
Cause you keep my feet on the ground

You're a true friend</description></item><item><title> Girl boss Kim Kardashian gets her way as Tyra Banks becomes a Skims Icon Fri 28 October 2022 16</title><link>/girl-boss-kim-kardashian-gets-her-way-as-tyra-banks-becomes-a-skims-icon.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/girl-boss-kim-kardashian-gets-her-way-as-tyra-banks-becomes-a-skims-icon.html</guid><description>Kim Kardashian couldn‚Äôt believe it when model Tyra Banks joined her Skims Iconic campaign which brought together influential models across the globe.
